# Ideas for improvement
- Automatically recognize generator-m-ionic project
  - get rid of: failed build necessity
- build according to greenhouse-ci.sh (deliver with project, sub-generator!)
  - get rid of: set environment variable and add greenhouse-ci.sh script
- or: allow configuration via interface (which platform, env, icon sets, ...)
- speed up `npm i && bower i` by not discarding them every time, or npm caching on greenhouse servers
