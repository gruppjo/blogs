About two weeks ago, finally, the glorious and highly anticipated [JSConf EU](http://2017.jsconf.eu/) took place. You may have heard! Right here at the heart of the universe, Berlin. May 6 through 7. And it was totally-super-frickin-awesome!

?? Read on for a wild, impressing ride through the whole event and a selection of the best talks that I attended.

?? JSConf? The smartest gals and guys in JS-Tech meet lovable dorkiness, emoji-creativity and the best of your local LGBT gathering.

### Getting ready.

Having JavaScript at the top of my technology-stack for more than 8 years as a Software and Open Source Developer, I knew I had to go. Absolutely. Arrangements were made, and I had the amazing opportunity to be one of the couple of hundred of people coming together from all over the world for everything concerning JavaScript. And, boy, was I excited and, boy, did I not know how bombastically awesome it was going to be!

But let's back up a little.

In late 2016, I learned about JSConf EU taking place through their [open call for speakers](http://2017.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/). Literally everyone could submit a proposal and through a carefully conducted selection process the [team](http://2017.jsconf.eu/about/) ([@cramforce](https://twitter.com/cramforce), [@hblank](https://twitter.com/hblank), [@janl](https://twitter.com/janl), [@fox](https://twitter.com/fox)) behind JSConf came up with an [incredible line-up of speakers](http://2017.jsconf.eu/speakers/) chosen out of more than 600 submitted proposals.

A few months prior to the conference they kept announcing one speaker after another and with every new announcement my heart-rate went up. It just kept getting better and better, the topics and speakers (as you'll soon see) were so much more diverse than I expected. Yes!

I got so excited, the week before the conference, I made sure everybody at my company knew that I was going to JSConf EU and that is was going to be fantastic. I got my business cards ready, polished [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/jonathangrupp) and made a note for our office door. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW!

Did they understand what I was talking about? - No.  
Did I annoy all of them? - Yes.  
Did I care? - Not at all!

*"Jonathan, do you have the files for that thing I need?"* - *"No Jenni, but I can tell you what I do have. A file containing a ticket for JSConf!"*

*"Jonathan, can you give me feedback on the design changes I made?"* - *No Lars, but I can give a really long twitter feed on why JSConf is awesome!*

"*Jonathan, do you want to join us for lunch?"* - *"No Kathrin, but do you know where they will also have really good lun..."* - **Shut up, Jonathan.**

### The day has come.
May 6, public transport to [Arena Berlin](http://www.arena.berlin/), 8:15 and by the way to early for a Saturday morning. Am I on the right bus?

I look around: trendy Herschel backpacks, authentic nerd glasses and a curly-haired woman reminiscing: *"... and then I realized how cool DHTML was back in the days!"*

I'm on the right bus.

I meet Sues from Brooklyn who goes on to tell me about her friend who organized brooklyn.js, we get inside, everything is purple and blue, I get my badge and then - thank god there's breakfast - I chat with Sonja who's here with her colleagues from Amsterdam. Hipster-beards, neon-blue undercut hairstyles, gender-neutral bathrooms and an appealing assortment of organic lemonade and other beverages everywhere.


Wow, ohh... do I feel at home!

9:27, suddenly a booming smooth bass comes from the speakers, everybody turns their head. Add a pleasant robot voice: "JAVASCRIPT - PEOPLE GOT MAD". [@nested_loops](https://twitter.com/nested_loops) open JSConf with their amazing audio-video and light performance.

All done live, with...  
Guess what?

JavaScript. (Yes even the lights of the whole conference stage!)

You can see the full video on the [JSConf Youtube Account - opening JSConf EU 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCn-XCASn98) and even the talk where they [explain how they did everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpKLt_YO3o8).

### Day one in JavaScript wonderland
Admittedly the hardest part was deciding which talks I wanted to see. Because, well, ... I wanted to see all of them! However, as you know, we all have to make possibly life-changing decision at some points in our lives and [@philnash](https://twitter.com/philnash)'s Service-Worker-powered, offline-ready version of the [JSConf EU 2017 schedule](https://jsconf.philna.sh/) sure helped me to make the proper ones.

Add that to your mobile's home screen and no worries about internet-connectivity and spotty wifi-connection for the whole weekend! How cool is that?

After the grand opening, the conference was kicked-off by no one less than Google's [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/) with his content-packed talk about page loading performance. My two most important take-aways to look at: Google's [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) automation tool and a curated list of articles on that topic at  [medium.com/reloading](https://medium.com/reloading).

##### Anjana Vakil: Immutable data structures for functional JS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo0qiGPSV-s

"Functional programmig rocks"
"Just sit there like a rock doing nothing".
Mutability unexpected changes.

Challenges (copy wastes time & space) and the magic behind hash array mapped tries that make immutable data structures really fast.

mori (more functional/lisp-like interface), immutable js (facebook, oo like)
