About two weeks ago, finally, the glorious and highly anticipated [JSConf EU](http://2017.jsconf.eu/) took place. You may have heard! Right here at the heart of the universe, Berlin. May 6 through 7. And it was totally-super-frickin-awesome!

?? JSConf? The smartest gals and guys in JS-Tech meet lovable dorkiness, emoji-creativity and the best of your local LGBT gathering.

### Getting ready.

Having JavaScript at the top of my technology-stack for more than 8 years as a Software and Open Source Developer, I knew I had to go. Absolutely. Arrangements were made, and I had the amazing opportunity to be one of the couple of hundred of people coming together from all over the world for everything concerning JavaScript. And, boy, was I excited and, boy, did I not know how bombastically awesome it was going to be!

But let's back up a little.

In late 2016, I learned about JSConf EU taking place through their [open call for speakers](http://2017.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/). Literally everyone could submit a proposal and through a carefully conducted selection process the [team](http://2017.jsconf.eu/about/) ([@cramforce](https://twitter.com/cramforce), [@hblank](https://twitter.com/hblank), [@janl](https://twitter.com/janl), [@fox](https://twitter.com/fox)) behind JSConf came up with an [incredible line-up of speakers](http://2017.jsconf.eu/speakers/) chosen out of more than 600 submitted proposals.

A few months prior to the conference they kept announcing one speaker after another and with every new announcement my heart-rate went up. It just kept getting better and better, the topics and speakers (as you'll soon see) were so much more diverse than I expected. Yes!

I got so excited, the week before the conference, I made sure everybody at my company knew that I was going to JSConf EU and that is was going to be fantastic. I got my business cards ready, polished [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/jonathangrupp) and made a note for our office door. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW!

Did they understand what I was talking about? - No.  
Did I annoy all of them? - Yes.  
Did I care? - Not at all!

*"Jonathan, do you have the files for that thing I need?"* - *"No Jenni, but I can tell you what I do have. A file containing a ticket for JSConf!"*

*"Jonathan, can you give me feedback on the design changes I made?"* - *No Lars, but I can give a really long twitter feed on why JSConf is awesome!*

"*Jonathan, do you want to join us for lunch?"* - *"No Kathrin, but do you know where they will also have really good lun..."* - **Shut up, Jonathan.**

### The day has come.
May 6, public transport to [Arena Berlin](http://www.arena.berlin/), 8:15 and by the way to early for a Saturday morning. Am I on the right bus?

I look around: trendy Herschel backpacks, authentic nerd glasses and a curly-haired woman reminiscing: *"... and then I realized how cool DHTML was back in the days!"*

I'm on the right bus.

I meet Sues from Brooklyn who goes on to tell me about her friend who organized brooklyn.js, we get inside, everything is purple and blue, I get my badge and then - thank god there's breakfast - I chat with Sonja who's here with her colleagues from Amsterdam. Hipster-beards, neon-blue undercut hairstyles, gender-neutral bathrooms and an appealing assortment of organic lemonade and other beverages everywhere.


Wow, ohh... I feel at home!

9:27, suddenly a booming loud bass comes from the speakers, everybody turns their head. Add a pleasant robot voice "JAVASCRIPT - PEOPLE GOT MAD". [@nested_loops](https://twitter.com/nested_loops) open JSConf with their amazing audio-video and light performance.

All done live in...  
Guess what?

JavaScript. (Ok and CSS)
