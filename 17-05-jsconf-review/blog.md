About two weeks ago, finally, the glorious and highly anticipated [JSConf EU](http://2017.jsconf.eu/) took place. You may have heard! Right here at the heart of the universe, Berlin. May 6 through 7. And it was totally-super-frickin-awesome!

?? In case you missed it!

?? Read on for a wild, impressing ride through the whole event and a selection of the best talks that I attended.

?? JSConf? The smartest gals and guys in JS-Tech meet lovable dorkiness, emoji-creativity and the best of your local LGBT gathering.

## Getting ready.

Having JavaScript at the top of my technology-stack for more than 8 years as a Software and Open Source Developer, I knew I had to go. Absolutely. Arrangements were made, and I had the amazing opportunity to be one of the couple of hundred of people coming together from all over the world for everything concerning JavaScript. And, boy, was I excited and, boy, did I not know how bombastically awesome it was going to be!

But let's back up a little.

In late 2016, I learned about JSConf EU taking place through their [open call for speakers](http://2017.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/). Literally everyone could submit a proposal and through a carefully conducted selection process the [team](http://2017.jsconf.eu/about/) ([@cramforce](https://twitter.com/cramforce), [@hblank](https://twitter.com/hblank), [@janl](https://twitter.com/janl), [@fox](https://twitter.com/fox)) behind JSConf came up with an [incredible line-up of speakers](http://2017.jsconf.eu/speakers/) chosen out of more than 600 submitted proposals.

A few months prior to the conference they kept announcing one speaker after another and with every new announcement my heart-rate went up. It just kept getting better and better, the topics and speakers (as you'll soon see) were so much more diverse than I expected. Yes!

I got so excited, the week before the conference, I made sure everybody at my company knew that I was going to JSConf EU and that is was going to be fantastic. I got my business cards ready, polished [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/jonathangrupp) and made a note for our office door. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW!

</p>

Did they understand what I was talking about? - No.
Did I annoy all of them? - Yes.
Did I care? - Not at all!

*"Jonathan, do you have the files for that thing I need?"* - *"No Jenni, but I can tell you what I do have. A file containing a ticket for JSConf!"*

*"Jonathan, can you give me feedback on the design changes I made?"* - *No Lars, but I can give a really long twitter feed on why JSConf is awesome!*

"*Jonathan, do you want to join us for lunch?"* - *"No Kathrin, but do you know where they will also have really good lun..."* - **Shut up, Jonathan.**

## The day has come.
May 6, public transport to [Arena Berlin](http://www.arena.berlin/), 8:15 and by the way to early for a Saturday morning. Am I on the right bus?

I look around: trendy Herschel backpacks, authentic nerd glasses and a curly-haired woman reminiscing: *"... and then I realized how cool DHTML was back in the days!"*

I'm on the right bus.

I meet Sues from Brooklyn who goes on to tell me about her friend who organized brooklyn.js, we get inside, everything is purple and blue, I get my badge and then - thank god there's breakfast - I chat with Sonja who's here with her colleagues from Amsterdam. Hipster-beards, neon-blue undercut hairstyles, gender-neutral bathrooms and an appealing assortment of organic lemonade and other beverages everywhere.

Wow, ohh... do I feel at home!

9:27, suddenly a booming smooth bass comes from the speakers, everybody turns their head. Add a pleasant robot voice: "JAVASCRIPT - PEOPLE GOT MAD". [@nested_loops](https://twitter.com/nested_loops) open JSConf with their amazing audio-video and light performance.

All done live, with...
Guess what?

JavaScript! (Yes even the lights of the whole conference stage!)


You can see the full video on the [JSConf Youtube Account - opening JSConf EU 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCn-XCASn98) and even the talk where they [explain how they did everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpKLt_YO3o8).

## Day one in JavaScript wonderland
Admittedly the hardest part was deciding which talks I wanted to see. Because, well, ... I wanted to see all of them! However, as you know, we all have to make possibly life-changing decision at some points in our lives and [@philnash](https://twitter.com/philnash)'s Service-Worker-powered, offline-ready version of the [JSConf EU 2017 schedule](https://jsconf.philna.sh/) sure helped me to make the proper ones.

Add that to your mobile's home screen and no worries about internet-connectivity and spotty wifi-connection for the whole weekend! How cool is that?

Unfortunately I had a even harder time deciding which talks to write about in this blog post. There were just so many good ones. Hence, please regard the following as a best effort and a compromise between the awesomeness of the talk and the availability of resources for you to look at. The [JSConfEU youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/jsconfeu) is currently updated with videos every couple of days, so be sure to check it out!

Let's dive in!


#### Addy Osmani - The browser hacker's guide to instantly loading everything
After the grand opening, the conference was kicked-off by no one less than Google's [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/) ([@addyosmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani)) with his content-packed talk about page loading performance. My two most important take-aways to look at: Google's [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) automation tool and a curated list of articles on that topic at  [medium.com/reloading](https://medium.com/reloading).

#### Anjana Vakil: Immutable data structures for functional JS
Can a simple rock serve as a useful metaphor for programming constructs? Yes indeed: Anjana Vakil ([@AnjanaVakil](https://twitter.com/AnjanaVakil)) shows us how with her emoji-filled introduction to immutable data structures and immutability in general.

<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="img/3_immutable.png">
</p>

While talking about the benefits (no unexpected changes!) and the challenges (copying data wastes time & space) that come with implementing immutable data structures she also explores [mori](https://github.com/swannodette/mori) and Facebook's [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) as two viable choices for working with immutable data structures in JavaScript.

Her whole talk is available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo0qiGPSV-s)!


#### Ruth John: How To Be A Web A/V Artist
*"Winamp, Winamp, Winamp - it really whips the Llama's ass!"* - do you remember that [phrase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaF-nRS_CWM)? You probably do, if you were trying to play mp3s on your computer about 15 years ago. If so, you might also remember Winamp Media Player's awesome [live visualization feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-34Qqd0mAfo) that reacts to the music/sounds you are playing.

Ruth John's ([@Rumyra](https://twitter.com/Rumyra)) enchanting talk does exactly that but way cooler and also in the browser. IN REAL-TIME! Visualisations reacting to her voice, the music, the audience. She does all sorts of cool A/V stuff in the browser together with the other membors of the [live:js collective](http://livejs.network/).

<p align="center">

</p>

Unfortunately her talk is not available on the [JSConf youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/jsconfeu) (yet?), I'll let you know of any updates!

#### Ashley Williams - A Brief History of Modularity
If you have watched [@nested_loops](https://twitter.com/nested_loops)' opening video you may have wondered: *"Why did all the people get mad?"*. The answer is modularity.

Ashley Williams ([@ag_dubs](https://twitter.com/ag_dubs)) explores in her talk why we even use modules, what separation of concerns means exactly, and what the costs and dangers of using modules are. And yes there's cost to modularity, that's why there's projects like [closure](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler), [prepack](https://github.com/facebook/prepack) and [tsickle](https://github.com/angular/tsickle) to alleviate them.

<p align="center">

Her whole talk is available [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vypCsVm5z28), even the [slides](https://ashleygwilliams.github.io/jsconfeu-2017/#1). Awesome, check it out!

#### Aaaaaand ... Party!!

So while I was busy watching about 14 talks and having super delicious vegetarian meals and refreshing beverages in between, the whole day flew by in what feels like a blink of the eye.

Suddenly in the adjacent party location, I'm surrounded by lashing lights (even more than before), have a Gin&Tonic in my hands while the illustrious [LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafxR2HWJRmMfSdyZXvZMTw) rocks away the stage and the crowd, shooting laser beams of analog-synthiness out of his synth-bike intstrument.

<p align="center">

</p>

Wait what? - Yes, it's a bike and it's a music instrument. At the same time.

We drift into the night.

### Notes
Coffee break.

and also while being busy shoving my face with complimentary frozen yoghurt, deciding which awesome print I should get on my shirt, the whole day just flew by in its wholesome exhilirating greatness.

I was so impressed

Google Cloud Service Coding challenge? Chill out at the community area? Get connected with other people through the community board?
Some beach sand at the Badeschiff to unwind in between talks?

### Encouraged
To be myself, encouraged to participate, see how approachable and normal all these stunning people are. Cool!

And I wasn't the only one: https://twitter.com/nebrius/status/861278524719738881
