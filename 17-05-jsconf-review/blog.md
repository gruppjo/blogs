About two weeks ago, finally, the glorious and highly anticipated [JSConf EU](http://2017.jsconf.eu/) took place. You may have heard! Right here at the heart of the universe, Berlin. May 6 through 7. And it was totally-super-frickin-awesome!

### Getting ready

Having JavaScript at the top of my technology-stack for more than 8 years as a Software and Open Source Developer, I knew I had to go. Absolutely. Arrangements were made, and I had the amazing opportunity to be one of the couple of hundred of people coming together from all over the world for everything concerning JavaScript. And, boy, was I excited and, boy, did I not know how bombastically awesome it was going to be!

But let's back up a little.

In late 2016, I learned about JSConf EU taking place through their [open call for speakers](http://2017.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/). Literally everyone could submit a proposal and through a carefully conducted selection process the [team](http://2017.jsconf.eu/about/) ([@cramforce](https://twitter.com/cramforce), [@hblank](https://twitter.com/hblank), [@janl](https://twitter.com/janl), [@fox](https://twitter.com/fox)) behind JSConf came up with an [incredible line-up of speakers](http://2017.jsconf.eu/speakers/) chosen out of more than 600 submitted proposals.

A few months prior to the conference they kept announcing one speaker after another and with every new announcement my heart-rate went up. It just kept getting better and better, the topics and speakers (as you'll soon see) were so much more diverse than I expected. Yes!

I got so excited, the week before the conference, I made sure everybody at my company new that I was going to JSConf EU and that is was going to be fantastic. I got my business cards ready, polished [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/jonathangrupp) and made a note for our office door. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO KNOW!

Did they understand what I was talking about? - No.  
Did I annoy all of them? - Yes.  
Did I care? - Not at all!

*"Jonathan, do you have the files for that thing I need?"* - *"No Jenni, but I have a file containing a ticket for JSConf!"*

*"Jonathan, can you give me feedback on the design changes I made?"* - *No Lars, but I can give a really long twitter feed on why JSConf is awesome!*

"*Jonathan, do you want to join us for lunch?"* - *"No Kathrin, but do you know where they will also have lun..."* - **Shut up, Jonathan.**
