# Professional workflows for top-notch JavaScript and Front-End Engineers in 2017

Since the genesis of [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) and the heyday of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), tooling for JavaScript and Web Development has come a long way.

In the last years, questions of how we setup, code, quality-assure, maintain, build and deliver our projects, has sparked the creation of countless open source projects. Different seed projects, (Yeoman) generators, CLIs, task runners, snippet creators and sub-generators all aim to take some work off of our shoulders.

However it is easy to get lost in the vast amount of choices and in the last year Typescript, ES6, module loading and bundling and the rise of large framework choices like Angular 2 or React just piled up to the complexity of the whole topic. Thus nowadays, obtaining a setup that works well for you and your project can turn into a tedious and nightmarish task.

In this talk I will show you, how incredibly useful good workflows are and how they can boost your mood and productivity.

Join me in a guided discovery through the absurdities and treasures of the nearly infinite sea of JavaScript tooling.

My goal is to motivate you to  Motivation, why you should care about good workflows for your next projects.

In this talk I try to help you understand and rethink and inspire.

I give lively examples and little anecdotes stemming from my day-to-day work as a Senior Front-End Engineer and from my experience creating and maintaining Generator-M-Ionic, a Yeoman .



## Side notes


Long gone are the days where you could just create an `index.html`, link your `style.css` and `scripts.js` and you were ready to go.

At the same time project requirements grow more complex as JavaScript development grows into adulthood
Enforcing coding guidelines, pre-processing CSS among the simplest of task.
