- what's the target audience?
- be concise, maintain outer-perspective, non-techie perspective

## Reduced

In the last years, questions of how we setup, code, build, quality-assure, maintain and deliver our projects have sparked the creation of countless open source projects: different seed projects, (Yeoman) generators, CLIs, task runners, snippet creators and many many more.

They all aim to take some work off of our shoulders. However, it is easy to get lost in the vast amount of choices and nowadays, obtaining a setup that works well for you and your project can turn into a tedious and nightmarish task.

Join me in a guided discovery through the absurdities and treasures of the nearly infinite sea of JavaScript Front-End tooling.

This talk will show you how incredibly useful good workflows can be and is sprinkled with anecdotes stemming from my day-to-day work as a Front-End Engineer and Open Source Developer.

## Todo
- Analyse workflows in current projects (and how good/absurd they are)
- Analyse Angular CLI, Ionic CLI, FountainJS (JSFatigue)
- Compare with Generator-M-Ionic (add a new lib, other tasks)

## Prose

In the last years, questions of how we setup, code, quality-assure, maintain, build and deliver our projects, has sparked the creation of countless open source projects: different seed projects, (Yeoman) generators, CLIs, task runners, snippet creators and sub-generators all aim to take some work off of our shoulders.

However it is easy to get lost in the vast amount of choices and in the last year Typescript, ES6, module loading and bundling and the rise of large framework choices like Angular 2 or React just piled up to the complexity of the whole topic. Thus nowadays, obtaining a setup that works well for you and your project can turn into a tedious and nightmarish task.

In this talk I will show you, how incredibly useful good workflows are and how they can boost your own and your team's mood and productivity.

Join me in a guided discovery through the absurdities and treasures of the nearly infinite sea of JavaScript tooling.

I give lively examples and little anecdotes stemming from my day-to-day work as a Senior Front-End Engineer and from my experience creating and maintaining [Generator-M-Ionic](https://github.com/mwaylabs/generator-m-ionic), a Yeoman Generator with advanced workflows with Angular 1 and Ionic 1.


## Key Facts

### Why should you care about good workflows?
Good workflows can boost your team's productivity and spark useful discussions, they can professionalize your projects, even your whole development approach. They can positively impact development speed, code quality, reliability and many other aspects of your project: for instance how you setup, maintain, build and deliver your projects.

( ~~Other topics:~~
- ~~continuous integration~~
- ~~dependency management~~
)

### Who is this talk targeted at?
Seasoned Front-End and JavaScript Engineers, and aspiring ones. Everybody interested in boosting productivity. Maybe even project managers.

### How do I know?
I've been working on large-scale and complex Front-Ends for several years. Angular2, React, ES6, you name it. I created and still maintain Generator-M-Ionic, an open source project that standardized developing HTML5 mobile Apps with Ionic 1 and Cordova.

### What are you going take away from this talk?
- Hand-full of convincing arguments and vivid examples of how good workflows can make your development worry-free.
- A good map of all the available options to setup your projects, build your very own workflows and how they compare to each other: Gulp, Webpack, npm scripts, Yeoman Generators, CLIs


## Side notes


Long gone are the days where you could just create an `index.html`, link your `style.css` and `scripts.js` and you were ready to go.

At the same time project requirements grow more complex as JavaScript development grows into adulthood
Enforcing coding guidelines, pre-processing CSS among the simplest of task.

inspire to build your own, get engaged instead of just consuming. Create. Share. Learn
