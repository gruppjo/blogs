# Professional workflows for JavaScript and Front-End Engineers in 2017

Since the genesis of [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) and the heyday of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), tooling for JavaScript and Web Development has come a long way.

The questions of how we setup, code, quality-assure, maintain, build and deliver our projects, has sparked the creation of countless open source projects: different seeds, (yeoman) generators, CLIs, task runners, snippet creators and sub-generators all aim to take some work off of our shoulders.

Long gone are the days where you could just create an `index.html`, link your `style.css` and `scripts.js` and you were ready to go.

At the same time project requirements grow more complex as JavaScript development grows into adulthood
Enforcing coding guidelines, pre-processing CSS among the simplest of task

In the last year Typescript, ES6, module loading and bundling and the rise of large framework choices like Angular 2 or React just piled up to the complexity of the whole topic. Thus obtaining a setup that works well for you and your project can turn into a tedious and nightmarish task.

Join me in a guided discovery through the absurdities and treasures of the nearly infinite sea of JavaScript tooling.

In this talk I try to help you understand and rethink and inspire to build your own, get engaged instead of just consuming. Create. Share. Learn.

I give lively examples and little anecdotes stemming from my day-to-day work as a Senior Front-End Engineer and from my experience creating and maintaining Generator-M-Ionic and similar projects.

Motivation, why you should care about good workflows for your next projects.
